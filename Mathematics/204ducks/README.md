## The purpose of the project

Make probability calculations about ducks in a pond.

When ducks are disturbed by a sudden noise, they fly away almost simultaneously, leaving the pond empty.
Chances that a duck will then come back after t minutes are given by the following probability density
function.

The average time after which ducks come back,  
The standard deviation of the ducksâ€™ return time,  
The time after which 50% of all of the ducks are back,  
The time after which 99% of all of the ducks are back,  
The percentage of ducks that come back after 1 minute,  
The percentage of ducks that come back after 2 minutes.
